# Image Processing Project

This project contains an application where image processing techniques are applied using the Python programming language. Users can upload an image and apply various operations such as preprocessing, filtering operations, and morphological operations.

## Usage

1. Run the `main.py` file in the project's root directory.
2. Enter the path of your image.
3. Navigate through the menus to select the operation you want.
4. Apply operations to transform your image.
5. Save the results and exit whenever you want.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- PIL (Python Imaging Library)
- matplotlib
